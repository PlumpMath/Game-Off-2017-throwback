# Time trial

My submission to Game off 2017 game jam with theme *throwback*.

This is supposed to be inspired by Lotus III: Ultimate Challenge game, but is lacking in features - only basic mechanics are implemented.

## Controls:

- left/right arrows - steer left/right
- space/up arrow - accelerate
- down arrow - decelerate

This game uses awesome [love2d](https://love2d.org/) framework.
